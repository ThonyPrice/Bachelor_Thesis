% Address research questions here;

% 1. Does the feature selection improve the accuracy of classification compared to using all features?


Applying feature selection methods provides an improved classification accuracy on benign or malignant breast cancer when using an Artificial Neural Network classifier. The improvement of ANN was consistent over multiple datasets. No correlation between accuracy achieved by ANN and what FS-method used was found suggesting it is case-to-case dependent.

When using classifiers Decision Tree, Na\"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machine no increase, or decrease by using feature selection is significantly evident over multiple datasets. In some observations these classifiers manifested increased classification accuracy with feature selection compared to using the full dataset. The feature selection methods that improve these methods the most are generally wrappers such as SFS and SBS although they demand large computational time compared to filter methods, see results \ref{sec:cumtime}.

% 2. In which machine learning methods does feature selection have the greatest impact?

The machine learning classifier that overall benefited most from feature selection in terms of accuracy was Artificial Neural Network. On four different datasets with significantly different compositions, accuracy of ANN with feature selection compared to no feature selection, was improved. The largest improvement was a 51\% increase when applying the feature selection method entropy.
