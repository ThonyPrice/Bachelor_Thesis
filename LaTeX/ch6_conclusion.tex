\chapter{Conclusion}

% Address research questions here;

% 1. Does the feature selection improve the accuracy of classification compared to using all features?
% 2. In which machine learning methods does feature selection have the greatest impact?

Applying feature selection methods provides an improved classification accuracy on benign or malignant breast cancer. The result was consistent over multiple datasets and several classifiers. The improved accuracy was dependent on a classifier and feature selection method used, as well as which dataset being used on. Results indicate one needs to select these variables carefully to see improvements and further investigation on such methodology is needed.

The machine learning that overall benefited most from feature selection in terms of accuracy was X. On 4 different datasets with significantly different compositions in Y cases accuracy was improved. The larges improvement was Z\% when applying W method on the V dataset.

% Replace X with correct method, should easily be identified when completed the table column sums as these values represent gained accuracy compared to full dataset.
