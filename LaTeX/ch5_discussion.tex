\chapter{Discussion}

FNA is not that good compared to CNB \parencite{Topps2018}.

Ideas for discussion topics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Our research question: } Does the feature selection improve the accuracy of classification compared to using all features?
  \item Our results show that feature selection in almost every instance provided equal or improved results compared to using the full dataset.
  \item However, ambiguous results among the classifiers might indicate the combination of classifier and FS method must be selected with care
  \item \textbf{Our research question: } In which machine learning methods does feature selection have the greatest impact?
  \item Our results displayed a lot of fluctuation in the results of datasets with small number of features and in the ANN classifier
  \item FS might infer more tuning of classifier is required
  \item With that said, the largest improvement was seen in the XYZ method...  
\end{itemize}
