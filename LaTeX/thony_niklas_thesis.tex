%add a comment about FNA and RNA data?



Breast cancer is a disease of major concern and is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women \parencite{althuis2005}. At present there are no effective ways to prevent breast cancer. However, efficient diagnosis in an early stage can increase the chance of full recovery. This makes early detection and diagnosis an important issue and screening mammography is the primary imaging modality for early detection of breast cancer \parencite{tabar2001}.

Hospitals today are well equipped with data collection devices to do monitoring and data such as mammography screenings can be collected and shared in information systems. The data can be used by medical personnel to increase their understanding of different diseases. The data can also be used in computer aided diagnostic (CAD) where machine learning algorithms enable tools for intelligent data analysis. CAD makes use of machine learning techniques that learn a hypothesis, a statistical prediction about a patient's diagnosis from a large set of previously diagnosed examples.  The overarching purpose is to assist medical experts in more efficient and accurate diagnostics \parencite{li2007}. Machine learning algorithms is a well studied field within medical diagnosis and well suited for analyzing medical data especially within small specialized diagnostic problems such as breast cancer \parencite{kononenko2001}.

Multiple studies of CAD on breast cancer have been conducted, primarily focusing on classifying mammography data as malignant or not, such those of \textcite{ramos2012} and \textcite{akay2009}. The act of feature selection, removing redundant or irrelevant features from a dataset, can provide classifiers to be faster, more cost-effective and accurate [8]. It is also explicitly mentioned as a topic in need of more research in studies on breast cancer diagnostics \parencite{akin2011}.

\section{Research Question}

In our thesis we will study the impact of different feature selection methods on the classification rate of malignant breast cancer by different machine learning methods. We aim to answer the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Does the feature selection improve the accuracy of classification compared to using all features?
  \item In which machine learning methods does feature selection have the greatest impact?
  \item What features are most important for accurate classification of breast cancer?
\end{itemize}

Our hypothesis is that overall the feature selection will improve the classification rate of the machine learning methods used in the context of breast cancer classification. This hypothesis is based on previous research reported by \textcite{karabulut2012}, where it was found that classification accuracy on 15 different datasets was increased by the use of filter methods for feature selection.

Our research differs from the work presented in \parencite{karabulut2012} in the amount of datasets used and amount of classification methods. In our project we will put more emphasis on breast cancer using only datasets of that type. The previous work only investigated feature selection methods by filtering which we will extend by implementing wrapper methods. Lastly, the research scope in this thesis includes a study of the effect of different feature selection methods on Support Vector Machines (SVM), which was not discussed by \parencite{karabulut2012}.

\section{Approach}

Trials will be conducted with feature selection Wrapper methods and feature selection Filter methods. The result of the feature selection methods will be used with different classifiers to evaluate their performance. To broaden the base for comparison we use classifiers from different disciplines, Decision Tree (Logic Based Algorithms), ANN (Perceptron-Based Techniques), Naive Bayes (Statistical Learning Algorithms) and SVM (Support Vector Machines) \parencite{wallace2007}. Feature selection methods and classifiers are denoted in table \ref{table:methods}.

\end{center}
\end{table}

A comparison of the classification rate on the machine learning methods without any feature selection and with feature selection will be conducted in order to establish the importance of feature selection in different machine learning approaches when classifying breast cancer. The evaluation criteria will primary be F1 score that conveys the balance between recall and precision of classification performance \parencite{muc1992}.[add more info here] Several datasets with different types of features will be evaluated. For more information on the datasets see chapter \ref{sec:Datasets}

\section{Outline}

In the Background section earlier work on the topic will be more thoroughly presented on order to clarify how this thesis relates to the field. The following chapter, Methods will detail the methods used to achieve the results that are presented in chapter 4. Chapter 5 analyzes the result and finally chapter 6 draws conclusion based on the analysis.

\chapter{Background}

\section{Computer Aided Diagnostics}

Machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to computer-aided diagnosis where it by a computerized procedure provides a second objective opinion for the assistance of medical image interpretation and diagnosis \parencite{li2007}, \parencite{ni2016}. To make a CAD system samples with diagnosis i used for learning. In the case of breast cancer diagnosis a radiologist label scans which then can be used to learn a hypothesis whether a undiagnosed sample is benign or malignant cancer \parencite{li2007}.

\section{Breast Cancer} %add Fine needle aspiration in this chapter?

A study in Sweden by \textcite{tabar2001} found breast carcinoma mortality was reduced by 63\% after mammography was introduced. This clearly emphasize the benefits of screening which had resulted in a increased usage of the method to detect and diagnose breast cancer. The increasing demand for mammography image interpretation lead to a shortage of medical radiologist to perform this task and consequently non medical personnel supplement the mammography image interpretation (MII) \parencite{culpan2016}. As breast cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer mortality among women and more efficient diagnostics and pathology is high on demand the need of low-cost point-of-care is very much needed as stated by \textcite{martei2018}.\\

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a diagnostic tool to aspirate cell samples by sampling cells, staining them and examine under a microscope \parencite{FNA}. An example of such sample can be seen in \ref{fig:fna_nuclei}. The cell samples can be evaluated within 24 hours and the method is cost-effective and can be used as a preoperative tool for investigation of tumors. The method is also complication-free and has been widely used for the past 60 years.

\section{Feature Selection}

The benefits of selecting a subset of all available features are manyfold, among other it facilitates data visualization and data understanding, reduces the measurement and storage requirements and reduces training and utilization times. In cases with thousands of features it is essential to work with a subset of the data to produce results. \parencite{guyon2003}.

\subsection{Filter methods} %expand

Filters evaluate each feature independent from the classifier, rank the features after evaluation and take the superior ones. The evaluation can be performed by many methods such as Information Gain and Variance \parencite{guyon2003}.

\subsection{Wrapper methods} %expand

Wrappers utilize the learning machine of interest as a black box to score subsets of variable according to their predictive power \parencite{guyon2003}. The issue is as datasets become very large this method might be overly computational intense as finding the optimal subset is considered to be NP-hard \parencite{amaldi1998}.

\section{Related Work}

The application of machine learning onto breast cancer classification is a well studied one. Since machine learning proved valuable empirical results breast cancer datasets have been widely used to assess the performance of a multitude of classification strategies and methods. [Insert ref. to early paper here]. \\

\noindent
Exhaustive studies for optimal Classifiers has been made as by \parencite{ramos2012} which tested 20,000 classification configurations to evaluated their ability to correctly classify malignant cancer. The achieved a result of 0.996 under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\\

\noindent
With a foundation of well performing classifiers studies investigating more fine tuned approaches building upon earlier results were being made. \textcite{akin2011} demonstrated that ensemble learning can be used in CAD to improve the performance of rotation forest classifier. Using three different dataset and 30 classifying algorithms the average accuracy improved on all datasets by nearly 3\%.\\

\noindent
\textcite{Abdel-Ilah2017} reported further improvements on ANNs by investigating the optimal number of hidden layers and neurons for a feed forward back propagation network. The highest accuracy acheived was 98\% using 3 hidden layers and 21 neurons with three distinct transer functions. \\

\noindent
\textcite{akay2009} investigated the performance of classification of a SVM with a RBF kernel using feature selection, filtering by F-score. They achieved a classification accuracy of 99.51\% which accordingly was among the highest scores recorded by then (2007). \\
% Add method which achieved the result

\noindent
\textcite{karabulut2012} made a comparative study on the effect of feature selection on classification accuracy and found up to 15.55\% improvement on classification rates. The study used only filter algorithms for feature selection, among those were both information and Chi-square. The study applied the selected features on three classification methods, Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Network as Multilayer Perceptron, and J48 decision tree classifier on 15 different datasets including WBCD. \\

\noindent
Building upon this foundation of work our study seeks to complete the field by providing further investigation of unreported selection methods such as SBS and SFS and review their performance on a combination of classifiers from the previous research presented here.
