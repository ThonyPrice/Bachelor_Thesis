# Manuscript for presentation

## Agenda

I'm name1 and this is name2. We've found that feature selection significantly increases the classification accuracy of breast cancer when using an artificial neural network.

In this presentation we'll first tell you why this study was made.

Then, how we achieved our results, by what methods and proof of thier trustworthiness.

And last what these results conclude and should be put into context.

## About breast cancer

Something about tumours... They can be either benign or malignant, that is fatal or harmless(?)

Today breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women. However, early detection increases the chaces of survival and recovery.

The common way of classifying breast cancer mammography screenings. An image as the one here is produced and radiologist examine it to determine if a tumour is benign or malignant.

The process is both time consuming and studies has shown there is a large shortage of radiologists as mammographies are increasingly used.

Other studies has measured the accuracy of radiologist and estimated it to 70%. There has been work made to make this process more efficient.

That is, Computer aided diagnostics


## CAD and Machine Learning
